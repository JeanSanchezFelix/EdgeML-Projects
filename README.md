## Contents

### 1. Example Notebooks
This folder includes Jupyter notebooks that provide detailed examples and explanations of key optimization techniques:

- **Knowledge Distillation**: Learn how to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model.
- **Low Rank Approximation**: Explore techniques for reducing the rank of model weight matrices to save memory and computation.
- **Model Pruning**: Understand strategies to remove unnecessary parameters from a model to improve efficiency.
- **Model Quantization**: Discover methods to reduce model size and increase inference speed by lowering numerical precision.

### 2. Pruning Homework
- **Pruning Homework.ipynb**: A hands-on Jupyter notebook exercise focused on implementing and understanding model pruning.

### 3. Quantization Homework
- **input.py**: A Python script designed to accompany the quantization homework, serving as a starting point for further experimentation.
